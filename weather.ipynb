    "- The `free -h` command provides a summary of system memory usage in a human-readable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\"` command generates a timestamp in the format `YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS`. \n",

    "\n",

    "##### Benefits of Timestamped Files\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chronological Organization**: Files are automatically sorted by time, making them easier to locate and manage.\n",

    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, we take advantage of automation to streamline the weather data retrieval process. While we use `wget` in our script, it's worth mentioning its close alternative, `curl`, a widely used tool for transferring data with URLs. Created by Daniel Stenberg in 1997, `curl` has become a powerful and flexible tool for HTTP requests, capable of handling numerous protocols and use cases. Both `curl` and `wget` are essential tools in Linux-based systems, offering similar functionality with slight differences in syntax and features.\n",

    "##### Automating with `weather.sh`\n",
    "\n",
    "Manually running commands can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially for repetitive tasks. To simplify this process, we’ll create a bash script named `weather.sh` in the root of your repository. This script will automate the weather data download process from **Task 6**, saving the data directly into the `data/weather` directory with a timestamped filename.\n",

    "##### Script Details\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the `weather.sh` script:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "#! /bin/bash\n",
    "date  # Prints the current date and time at the start of the script\n",

    "date  # Prints the date and time again to show when the script ends\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Explanation of the Script\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`#! /bin/bash`**:\n",
    "   - This shebang line specifies that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`date`**:\n",
    "   - Prints the current date and time. This serves as a log for when the script starts and ends, aiding in debugging and tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`echo`**:\n",
    "   - Adds blank lines to improve the readability of the script's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`wget`**:\n",
    "   - Downloads the latest weather data from Met Éireann's API using the URL:  \n",
    "     [https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today](https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today).\n",
    "   - The `-O` option specifies the output file name, which includes a timestamp generated by the `date` command (`date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S_athenry.json\"`). This ensures each file has a unique name, making it easy to organize and identify.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Second `date`**:\n",
    "   - Prints the date and time again after the download, providing a clear indication of the script's duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Making the Script Executable\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the script runnable, grant it execution permissions using the following command:\n",

    "While [curl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL#:~:text=curl%20was%20first%20released%20in,exchange%20rates%20for%20IRC%20users.) is often used for similar tasks and offers more customization options, `wget` is tailored for file downloads, making it particularly effective in batch operations and automated workflows. Both tools are reliable, but `wget` simplifies tasks like saving files directly and managing interruptions during downloads.\n",
